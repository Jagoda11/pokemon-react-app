# Project Instructions

Build a web application that uses the Pok√©mon API to display a list of Pok√©mon and their details. The application should have two pages: a list of Pok√©mon and a detail page for each individual Pok√©mon. The detail page should also display the selected Pok√©mon's evolutions, if any.

## API Documentation

- Pok√©mon API Documentation
- Endpoint for Pok√©mon List: <https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon>
- Endpoint for Pok√©mon Details: <https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id> or name}/
- Endpoint for Pok√©mon Species: <https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/{id}>
- Endpoint for Pok√©mon Evolution Chain: You retrieve this from the species endpoint evolution_chain.url

## Technical Requirements

- Use any TypeScript framework (Angular, Vue, React, as long as it is TypeScript).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A list of 10 Pok√©mon should be displayed on the list page, including their names and images.
2. Users should be able to navigate in the list using next and previous buttons to get 10 new Pok√©mon.
3. Clicking on a Pok√©mon in the list should navigate to the detail page, which should display the Pok√©mon's name, image, abilities (names), and evolutions (if any).
4. If the selected Pok√©mon has evolutions, they should be displayed as a list with their images and names. Clicking on an evolution should navigate to its detail page.
5. Users should be able to navigate between the list and detail pages using the browser's back and forward buttons.
6. Users should be able to bookmark (web browser) or share a link of their favorite Pok√©mon's details page.

## Tests üß™

- Implement tests for bullet points 1 and 2 in the acceptance criteria.

## Note

You don't have to spend too much time on styling if you're limited on time. Just focus on building an application that will make even Pikachu proud.
