This is a React application built with TypeScript that leverages the Pokémon API to display a list of Pokémon and their detailed information.
The application consists of two primary pages:
a list of Pokémon
and a detail page for each individual Pokémon. The detail page also showcases the selected Pokémon's evolutions, if any.
The app features modern web development tools and best practices, including Webpack, Babel, ESLint, Prettier, and Jest for testing.

## 🚀 Deployment

This application is deployed using GitHub Pages. You can access it at [Pokémon React App](https://Jagoda11.github.io/pokemon-react-app).

## 🌐 GitHub Codespaces Support

This project includes a `.devcontainer.json` file which allows you to work on this project in a Docker container using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). This helps to maintain a consistent development environment, making it easier for you to collaborate with others without having to worry about individual setup.

GitHub Codespaces configures your development environment based on your project's needs using this file. When you create a new codespace for this project, the Codespaces environment is automatically configured as per the settings defined in `.devcontainer.json`.

To use GitHub Codespaces:

1. Navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Click the Code button and then click "Open with Codespaces".
3. Click "+ New codespace".

Your development environment is now set up and running in a Docker container in the cloud. All commands you run in the Codespaces terminal will be executed inside the container. Any changes you make to the project will be reflected in the container and vice versa.
